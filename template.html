		<h1>what is important</h1>
		<p>
			I am a planner and my motto is “If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.” I plan everything. I plan my work, the first thing I do in the morning is to make a Must-Do list and Waiting-To-Do list. I plan shopping, I always make a shopping list so I never wander in the supermarket wondering what is needed—it’s the best way to save time and money! I plan my career too. Since sophomore year I have planned to work as a marketing representative after graduating. So I began to undertake more elective courses in marketing and find related part-time jobs, as you can see on my resume
